## Notes on Deployment
- Application will be deployed on Heroku
- `db/migrations` files must be run in Heroku bash to set up tables.
- `seed.js` must be run in Heroku bash to seed the `climbing_routes` table from Mountain Project's API.
- The `SECRET_KEY` in `seed.js` is supressed in an `.env`. You will need to request your own credentials from Mountain Project and add the key in your own `.env` file.
